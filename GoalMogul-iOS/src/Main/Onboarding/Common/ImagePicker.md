# Image Picker

> An image picker allows user to either select an image from the local directory or take a picture. This action resolves with an image URL produced by the user.

## Usage
```javascript
import ImagePicker from './imagePicker';
```

You should replace `'./imagePicker'` with an applicable relative path.
